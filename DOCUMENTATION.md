# SovereignComm Official Documentation

## 1. Vision and Philosophy

### 1.1. The Manifesto: Why SovereignComm Exists

SovereignComm is an act of digital sovereignty. In a world where communication is controlled and monetized by third parties, we build an infrastructure that gives power back to the individual. Our mission is to create a communication network for a free society: resilient, censorship-resistant, and owned by its users.

### 1.2. Our Values

*   **Sovereignty:** Your key, your identity, your message. You are in control.
*   **Privacy:** Communication is a right. Our defenses are state-of-the-art cryptography and metadata obfuscation.
*   **Universal Access:** Connecting the unconnected is a pillar for equality and development.

## 2. User Guide

### 2.1. First Steps: Creating Your Identity

Your identity in SovereignComm is derived from a cryptographic key pair that only you hold. Keep your seed phrase in a safe place, as it is the only way to recover your access.

### 2.2. Sending Messages: Choosing Storage Duration

When sending a message or file, you will have control over its permanence on the network:

*   **Renewable Storage (1-5 years):** Ideal for most cases. Data is stored on the **Filecoin** network. The cost is lower and paid for a defined period (e.g., 1 year). You can renew the storage before the term expires.
*   **Permanent Storage:** For documents that must last forever. Data is stored on the **Arweave** network through a one-time payment. The initial cost is higher, but there are no renewal fees.

### 2.3. Reading Messages

Received messages will appear in your inbox. Only your private key can decrypt them.

### 2.4. User Choices and Sovereignty

The platform is designed to maximize user choice:

*   **Network Selection:** You can choose how your message is broadcast. If you are offline or in a censorship-heavy area, you can use the **LoRa/Mesh Network** option. If you have standard internet access, you can use **Wi-Fi/Internet** to connect directly to a gateway.
*   **Become a Network Participant:** Through a simple toggle in the settings, you can choose to operate your device as a **Mesh Node** or a full **Gateway** (if you have the required setup). By doing so, you help strengthen the network and earn incentives based on a reputation score for your contribution, which is especially critical during emergencies.
*   **Message Privacy:** You control the visibility of every message. You can send a standard **Private** message, protected by end-to-end encryption, or you can post a **Public** message, which is visible to everyone, acting as a public, immutable diary.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1. Message Flow (High-Level View)

1.  **Client:** You write a message. The client **compresses**, **encrypts**, and bundles it with any attachments into a single data package.
2.  **Gateway:** The client pays a gateway (via Lightning) and sends the encrypted data package.
3.  **IPFS:** The gateway uploads the package to IPFS, receiving a **Content ID (CID)**.
4.  **Blockchain:** The gateway batches this CID with others into a **Merkle Tree** and anchors the **Merkle Root** onto a blockchain (Bitcoin, Stacks, L2s), ensuring the record's immutability.

### 3.2. Data Structure (IPLD and Metadata Obfuscation)

To protect your privacy, we do not store a list of messages. We use IPLD (Inter-Planetary Linked Data) to create a data graph. The main CID points to an object containing links to your inbox and outbox, which in turn point to individual message CIDs using unique, non-sequential identifiers (UUIDs). This makes it impossible for an observer to know how many messages you have.

### 3.3. Cryptography and Security (E2EE, Network Privacy)

*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Standard for all communications. Only the sender and receiver can read the content. Gateways only transport encrypted data.
*   **Network Privacy:** For maximum security, the client should be configured to communicate with gateways through an anonymity network like **Tor**, hiding your IP address.

## 4. The Economic Model: The Sovereign Network

### 4.1. The Payment Flow (Client -> Gateway via Lightning)

The system uses micropayments on the Lightning Network to create a market economy. The client requests the service from a gateway, receives a Lightning invoice, pays it, and only then is the service executed. It's fast, cheap, and trustless.

### 4.2. The Anchoring Service (Batching with Merkle Trees)

Anchoring each message individually on the blockchain would be too expensive. Instead, gateways batch hundreds of CIDs into a single Merkle Tree and record only the Merkle Root, diluting the on-chain transaction cost among many users.

### 4.3. Gateway Governance (Staking, Reputation, and Slashing)

To ensure gateways act honestly, they must deposit capital (stake) in a smart contract. If a gateway receives a payment and fails to provide the corresponding "proof of anchoring," their stake is "slashed" as punishment, and the user can be compensated. This aligns incentives and protects the network.

### 4.4. Persistent Storage (IPFS + Filecoin + Arweave)

*   **IPFS:** Used as a fast caching layer and for initial data distribution.
*   **Filecoin:** The backbone for renewable and medium-term storage.
*   **Arweave:** The solution for permanent, long-term storage.

### 4.5. Cost Minimization Strategies (Compression, Bundling)

The cost for the user is actively minimized through:
*   **Compression:** The client compresses all data before encryption.
*   **Bundling:** The client groups multiple files and the message into a single IPFS object, resulting in a single CID to be anchored.

### 4.6. Anchoring Flexibility (Multi-Chain)

The gateway software is designed to be blockchain-agnostic. It can choose the most efficient anchoring platform (in cost and security) at the moment, whether it's Bitcoin (via OP_RETURN), Stacks, or an Ethereum L2.

## 7. Technical Deep Dive

### 7.1. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. Key components and pages include:

*   **`Settings.tsx`**: This page serves as the main user control panel. As of the latest updates, it includes:
    *   **Wallet Connection Status**: Displays the user's connected wallet address and network.
    *   **Subscription & Usage (`Assinatura & Uso`)**: A section that displays the user's current plan (e.g., "Plano BÃ¡sico" / "Basic Plan") and usage quotas (e.g., max attachment size). It features an "Upgrade" button to navigate to the plan selection page.
    *   **Privacy & Display Toggles**: Switches for features like "Public Mode" and "Auto-refresh Inbox".

*   **`Upgrade.tsx`**: A placeholder page linked from the Settings page, intended for users to select and upgrade their subscription plans in the future.

### 7.2. Database Schema (Supabase)

To support user accounts, subscriptions, and usage tracking, the following database schema is proposed for implementation in Supabase.

*   **`plans` Table**: Stores the available subscription plans.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE plans (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      name TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'Basic', 'Sovereign'
      price_monthly INT NOT NULL, -- Price in cents or smallest currency unit
      storage_quota_gb INT NOT NULL,
      max_attachment_size_mb INT NOT NULL,
      active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
    );
    ```

*   **`user_profiles` Table**: Extends the default `auth.users` table with application-specific data.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      plan_id UUID REFERENCES plans(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
      storage_used_bytes BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
      updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
    );
    ```
